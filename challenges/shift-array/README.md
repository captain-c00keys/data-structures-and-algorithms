# Shift Array
**Author** : Gene Pieterson
**Version**: 0.1.0
## Overview
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition. You may round up in the event that the array has an odd number of indexes.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

## Getting Started
Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
Do all your work in a public repository called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formated, detailed top level README.md matching the example provided by your instructor
Create a branch in your repository called shift-array
On your branch, create a file called shift-array, with the proper file extension for your programming language
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
